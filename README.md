# Welcome to Meteor's Github repository
 Meteor is a versatile PaperMC server manager.<br>
 <br>
 It seems that you are a bit early, Meteor's development has just begun and the plugin doesn't do much therefore there is no public artifact for now.
 
## License
 Meteor is published under the *All rights reserved* license.<br>
 <br>
 You are allowed to browse the code to see how it works for educational or security purposes, you cannot however copy the code and use it as your own nor distribute it.<br>
 If you are a developer you may use this plugin as a dependency in order to add new services that implement additional features or to use its API.<br>
 
## Requirements
 - PaperSpigot (or any fork that doesn't break its API, tested on MC 1.20.1 onwards)
