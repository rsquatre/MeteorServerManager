# Welcome to Meteor's GitHub repository
Meteor is a versatile PaperMC server manager.<br>
<br>
It seems that you are a bit early, Meteor's development has just begun and the plugin doesn't do much therefore there is no public artifact for now.
 
## License
Meteor is published under the *All rights reserved* license.<br>
<br>
You are allowed to browse the code to see how it works for educational or security purposes, you cannot however copy the code and use it as your own nor distribute it.<br>
If you are a developer you may use this plugin as a dependency in order to add new services that implement additional features or to use its API.<br>

## Disclaimer
I am not a professional developer and this code is not peer-reviewed. Any release (stable or not) is provided "as is" with no guarantees at all.<br>
Plugin development may pause or cease at any time. Efforts will be made to test the plugin and keep it compatible with previous releases (i.e. I try not to break everything but if you lose data and don't have a backup that's on you).

## Requirements
- PaperSpigot (or any fork that doesn't break its API, tested on MC 1.20.1 onwards)
- Java 17 or higher
 
## Server administrators & developers

A Maven repository will (probably) be provided once a stable artifact is ready for production or testing.<br>
A wiki listing features and (hopefully) how to set them up will be provided on this repository.<br>
A Discord server invite will be provided should you need help troubleshooting.
